# __n-step Bootstrapping__

## **n-step Bootstrapping**

## **n-step TD Prediction**
- Midground for Monte Carlo (MC) and TD methods
    - MC wait until the end of the episode to update the estimated reward
    - TD updates the estimated reward on the very next step
- *n-step*: waits n-steps to update the estimated reward (more than one, but less than all of them until termination)
